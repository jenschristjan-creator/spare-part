Spare Parts Inventory

This project is a basic C program that simulates a spare parts inventory system. The user selects a part, and the program randomly determines whether the item is available.
The main purpose of the project is to practice handling user input, using arrays, working with loops, and generating random values in C.
The code is simple and easy to modify if additional parts or features are needed.
